    MODULE INFO

    Internal API mainly splits logic between calling GEMMA legacy and
    faster-lmm-d code.

    Functions starting with 'internal_' are an internal complement
    that typically handle GEMMA state. These functions should not be
    used outside GEMMA and do not expose a "C" interface for general
    use.
